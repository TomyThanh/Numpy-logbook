# Numpy-logbook


In this logbook, I collect my notes, code snippets, and exercises related to NumPyâ€”the foundational Python package for scientific computing. It covers topics such as arrays, vectorization, broadcasting, mathematical operations, and efficient data manipulation. Perfect for deepening the fundamentals and advanced techniques of NumPy in a hands-on way.
